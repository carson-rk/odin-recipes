    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups sushi or short-grain rice</li>
        <li>2 cups water (for cooking the rice)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>Optional: A piece of kombu (dried kelp) for extra umami flavor</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Rinse the rice: </strong>Place the sushi rice in a fine-mesh sieve and rinse under cold water until the water runs clear. This removes excess starch and prevents the rice from becoming too sticky.</li>
        <li><strong>Soak the rice:</strong> Transfer the rinsed rice to a pot or rice cooker and add 2 cups of water. Let it soak for about 30 minutes to allow the grains to absorb water evenly.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the rice:</strong>Cook the rice according to your rice cooker instructions or bring the water and rice to a boil on the stove, then reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 15 minutes. Remove from heat and let it steam with the lid on for another 10 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the sushi vinegar:</strong> While the rice cooks, combine rice vinegar, sugar, and salt in a small saucepan. Heat gently, stirring until the sugar and salt dissolve. Do not boil. Remove from heat and let it cool.</li>
        <li><strong>Season the rice:</strong> Transfer the cooked rice to a large, shallow bowl (a wooden sushi oke or hangiri is ideal). Gradually pour the vinegar mixture over the rice while gently folding with a wooden spatula or rice paddle to evenly coat the grains without crushing them.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool the rice:</strong> Use a fan or a piece of cardboard to cool the rice as you mix, which gives it a nice glossy finish. Once cooled to room temperature, the sushi rice is ready to use.</li>
        
    </ol>
