    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>400g spaghetti</li>
        <li>50g pancetta or guanciale, diced</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup grated Pecorino Romano or Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, peeled</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Cook the spaghetti:</strong> Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the spaghetti until al dente, according to package instructions. Reserve 1 cup of pasta water, then drain the pasta.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the pancetta:</strong> While pasta cooks, heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add garlic cloves and pancetta, cooking until pancetta is crisp and golden. Remove and discard garlic.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the sauce:</strong> In a bowl, whisk together eggs, grated cheese, and a generous amount of black pepper.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine pasta and pancetta:</strong> Add the drained pasta to the skillet with pancetta. Toss well over low heat.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix in egg mixture:</strong> Remove skillet from heat. Quickly add the egg and cheese mixture to the pasta, stirring vigorously to create a creamy sauce without scrambling the eggs. Add reserved pasta water a little at a time if the sauce is too thick.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve immediately: </strong>Plate the carbonara and finish with extra cheese and black pepper to taste.</li>
    </ol>
