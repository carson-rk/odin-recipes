# Odin Recipes

This is a simple recipe website built as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum. The goal of this project is to reinforce foundational HTML skills by creating a multi-page site from scratch using only HTML.

## Project Overview

The site will consist of a main index page linking to several individual recipe pages. Each recipe page will include headings, paragraphs, images, and lists, all structured with semantic HTML elements.

## Skills Demonstrated

By the end of this project, I will have:

- Practiced writing clean, semantic HTML code.
- Structured multiple web pages with internal linking.
- Used proper document hierarchy (headings, body, etc.).
- Embedded images and formatted content using lists and paragraphs.
- Gained hands-on experience organizing files and linking between them.

This project serves as a foundation for more advanced topics like CSS, JavaScript, and responsive design coming later in the course.
